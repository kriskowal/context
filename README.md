# context

Context is a JavaScript solution to cancelling asynchronous work with promises.
Pass a context forward as an argument, return a promise for the result.


## withTimeout

Contexts can be attenuated with a timeout, `context = context.withTimeout(ms)`.

```js
let context = require("@kriskowal/context");

async function main() {
    try {
        await count(context.withTimeout(100), 10);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
    }
}

async function count(context, ms) {
    let n = 0;
    for (;;) {
        console.log(n++);
        await context.delay(ms);
    }
}

main()
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
context expired
```

## withCancel

Cancel all work in a child context, `let cancel; ({context, cancel) =
context.withCancel()); cancel(new Error("please stop"))`.

```js
let context = require("@kriskowal/context");

async function main(context) {
    try {
        let cancel;
        ({context, cancel} = context.withCancel());
        monitor(context, cancel);
        await count(context, 10);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
    }
}

async function monitor(context, cancel) {
    await context.delay(100);
    cancel(new Error("deadline elapsed"));
}

async function count(context, ms) {
    let n = 0;
    for (;;) {
        console.log(n++);
        await context.delay(ms);
    }
}

main(context)
```


## delay

Run a timer in a context. `context.delay(ms)` returns a promise that will resolve
after `ms` or reject if the context times out or gets cancelled.


## get

Contexts are immutable, to avoid name conflict hazards.
Contexts can be used as keys to WeakMaps, for "context scoped storage" (CSS).
To retrieve the value for a context or any of its parents, call `context.get(map)`.

```js
var context = require("@kriskowal/context");
var tokens = new WeakMap();

async function main(context) {
    tokens.set(context, "Hello, World!");
    context = context.create();
    try {
        await child(context);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
    }
}

async function child(context) {
    await context.delay(100);
    console.log(context.get(tokens));
    await context.delay(100);
}

main(context);
```


## cancelled

Every context has a `cancelled` promise.
Use this promise to effect cancellation to third-party functions that have
their own cancellation interface.
For example, the context delay method uses `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`.

```js
function delay(context, ms) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let handle = setTimeout(resolve, ms);
        context.cancelled.then((error) => {
            clearTimeout(handle);
            reject(error);
        }, () => {});
    });
}
```

The DOM `fetch` function supports a cancellation signal.

```js
function fetchWithContext(context, path, options) {
    if (options == null) {
        options = {};
    }
    let abortController = new AbortController();
    options.signal = abortController.signal;
    context.cancelled.then(() => {
        abortController.abort();
    });
    return fetch(path, options);
}
```

The late XMLHttpRequest API (RIP) also had an API for cancellation.

```js
function xhr(context, method, location) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) {
        let request = new XMLHttpRequest();

        let onLoad = () => {
            if (xhrSuccess(request)) {
                resolve(request.responseText);
            } else {
                onError();
            }
        };

        let onError = () => {
            var error = new Error("Can't " + method + " " + JSON.stringify(location));
            if (request.status === 404 || request.status === 0) {
                error.code = "ENOENT";
                error.notFound = true;
            }
            reject(error);
        };

        // <<<<<<<<<<

        context.cancelled.then(() => {
            request.abort();
        }, () => {});

        // >>>>>>>>>>
        
        try {
            request.open(method, location, true);

            request.onreadystatechange = () => {
                if (request.readyState === 4) {
                    onLoad();
                }
            };
            request.onLoad = onLoad;
            request.onError = onError;

            request.send();

        } catch (exception) {
            reject(exception);
        }
    });
}

// Determine if an XMLHttpRequest was successful
// Some versions of WebKit return 0 for successful file:// URLs
function xhrSuccess(req) {
    return (req.status === 200 || (req.status === 0 && req.responseText));
}
```


## Cancel dangling work

Cancelling in a finally clause ensures that a function leaves no loose threads
running after it has returned.
In this example, two functions race to finish a job, and we can cancel the jobs
that lost the race.

```js
async function main(context) {
    try {
        await race(context);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.stack);
    }
}

async function race(context) {
    let cancel;
    ({context, cancel} = context.withCancel());
    try {
        let tortoise = racer(context, "tortoise", 100, 1000);
        let hare = racer(context, "hare", 1000, 900);
        let winner = await Promise.race([tortoise, hare]);
        console.log(winner, "wins the race");
    } finally {
        cancel();
    }
}

async function racer(context, name, sleep, speed) {
    try {
        console.log(name, "takes a nap")
        await context.delay(sleep);
        console.log(name, "starts racing");
        await context.delay(speed);
        console.log(name, "crosses the finish line");
        return name;
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(name, "loses the race");
        throw error;
    }
}
```

Output:

```
tortoise takes a nap
hare takes a nap
tortoise starts racing
tortoise crosses the finish line
tortoise wins the race
hare loses the race
```

Note that the hare exits through an exception.


## Why are promises not cancellable?

Promises are not themselves directly cancellable because that would introduce a
hazard.

A promise is a contract between a single producer and possibly multiple
consumers.
If promises had a cancel method, one consumer would be able to interfere with
all other consumers by cancelling it.
This is particularly pernicious in the common pattern of a memoized async
function.

Alternatively to immediately stopping work when a promise was cancelled,
a promise might count as a single subscription, where cancellation
were unsubscription, and having zero subscribers triggered the cessation of
work.
To do so, every consumer would need a unique promise instance.
This could be facilitated by creating a fresh child promise for every consumer,
perhaps by calling `then` without arguments, but generally, the hazard would
remain since the necessity would be surprising.

The only way for a cancel method on a subscriber to work would be for the
promise to enforce that it only had one consumer, forcing an error on the
second attempt to register a subscriber.

```js
promise.then(onReturn2, onThrow2);
promise.then(onReturn2, onThrow2); // Throws an error
```

Such an object would not be a Promise as we have come to know JavaScriptâ€™s
Promise.
It might be an object by another name.

This solution, however, works well for Promises, using Promises.


## Prior Art

This library stems from a suggestion by Mark Miller that cancellation could be
effected through a `cancelled` promise that one threaded as an argument
throughout a call graph.

```js
let cancel, cancelled = new Promise((r) => cancel = r);
let handle = setTimeout(cancel, 1000);
cancelled.then(() => clearTimeout(handle));
return main(cancelled);
```

This in itself is sufficient for threading cancellation.

Secondly, the Go [context][GoContext] inspires the creation of a `Context`
object that serves the three twined purposes of cancellation, deadlines, and
context local storage.

[GoContext]: https://golang.org/pkg/context/

The Go context also provides a mechanism to use the context itself as an
arbitrary but shallowly immutable key-value store, also discouraging name
collisions through the promotion of package-private-typed keys.

I again credit Mark Miller for teaching me the use of WeakMaps to associate and
gracefully release private data through immutable token objects.
